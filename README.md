# Spotify API 

A project for learning spotify's API and front-end web dev with React, Node.js and what not :) 

NOTE: Some of the features on the app will not work as the website is still running in development mode. Users accessing the app that want these features must be approved by me

Built With:
- Spotify Web API (JMPEREZ's wrapper functions)
- React.js
- Express backend (Following Spotify's OAuth Flow)
- Material UI components
